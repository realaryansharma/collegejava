Super is added in each class constructor automatically as the first statement by the compiler if there is not super and this in your program.

1) Instance inheritance block

It is used to inittialise instance data member.

Runs each time when instance of the class is instantitaed

it is  applicable with method, constructor and block.

Runs before the constructor

2) What happens when we have super keyword along with instance initialiser block.

3) Final method

4) If you have the class as final, you can not extend it

You can inherit the final method but you can't override.
