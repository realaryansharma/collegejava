1. Inheritance (a mechanism in which one object acquires all the prooerties and behavioues of a parent object)

    Why Use?

    1. Method Overiding
    2. Code Reusability

2. Extend Keyword

    We use the keyword "extends" to extend a parent class to child class
    {
        class SubClass-name extends SuperClass-name{}
    }

    Extend keyword is establishing a relation between Parent and Chile

3. Types OF Inheritance

    Single Inheritance
    Multilevel
    Heirarichal

    Question : Java doesn't support Multiple Inheritance, why?
